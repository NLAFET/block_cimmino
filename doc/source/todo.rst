Implementation TODO List
========================

* Make it possible to call ``job_id = 2`` after a call to ``job_id = 3``. This should give more power to ther user on the direct solver.
  Possible use cases:
  - Change the number of workers the direct solver has on a precise node
  - Change some ``MUMPS`` control parameters related to the Analysis and Factorization phases.
